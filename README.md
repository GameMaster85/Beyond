# Beyond
A chat program for roleplaying, to support multiple characters, actions, and expressions.

Set up is fairly simple (though they will require node and npm to work); just:

* [`Install node.js with npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Make sure your port of choice is forwarded
* Put the files in a folder
* Navigate to that folder with your command line (cd C:\Users\[yourname]\Beyond for instance)
* Use npm install in the command line to acquire the needed node modules (I do my best to keep this list small)
* Use node index.js to start the server
* Access the server with any modern browser

The server will make all other needed files for saving and management in the folder itself.
